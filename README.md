# GUPPSHUPP 💬

GUPPSHUPP is an experimental **AI-oriented chat application** that explores how intelligent systems can understand users over time and adapt their communication style accordingly.

At its core, the project demonstrates two key concepts:

* **Memory Extraction** – analyzing user conversations to identify preferences, emotional patterns, and long-term facts worth remembering.
* **Personality Engine** – dynamically transforming the assistant’s response tone (e.g., calm mentor, witty friend, therapist-style) based on context and user state.

The application simulates how modern conversational AI can move beyond static replies toward more human-like, personalized interactions, while being built on a fast and scalable frontend stack using **Vite**, **React**, and **TypeScript**.

* ⚛️ **React** – Component-based UI library
* 🟦 **TypeScript** – Type-safe JavaScript
* 🎨 **Tailwindcss / Modern Styling** – Clean and responsive UI
* 🧹 **ESLint** – Code quality and linting
